# Smart-fan-controlling-system
The Smart Fan Controlling System is an innovative project that uses image processing and hand gesture recognition to control the speed and direction of a fan. By leveraging a webcam, OpenCV, and the cvzone library, this system captures real-time video to detect hand gestures, which are then translated into commands for the fan.
