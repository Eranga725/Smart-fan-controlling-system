# Smart-fan-controlling-system
The Smart Fan Controlling System is an innovative project that uses image processing and hand gesture recognition to control the speed and direction of a fan. By leveraging a webcam, OpenCV, and the cvzone library, this system captures real-time video to detect hand gestures, which are then translated into commands for the fan.

Introduction
The smart fan controlling system leverages OpenCV for image processing and hand gesture recognition. It uses a webcam to capture real-time video, detect hand gestures, and control the fan's speed and direction based on the gestures.

# Features
Recognizes different hand gestures to control fan speed and direction.
Provides real-time feedback on the recognized gesture and the corresponding fan state.
Utilizes Arduino and PyFirmata for hardware control of the fan.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
cvzone
pyfirmata
Arduino board
